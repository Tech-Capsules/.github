Tech Capsules is a channel that aims to talk about technologies that a Software Engineer needs üñ•Ô∏èüí°

There are great people who provide more than wonderful content in this area, whether in Arabic or English. But I would like to talk about the tricks that a programmer faces while working. üßë‚Äçüíª‚ú® I mean, someone has already been working for a while and has a real job in the field, but he needs to know the implementation of a specific thing or choose a technology. Why and what is the difference between it and others? ü§îüîç

Other than that, there will be some videos for the updates in the field, such as the new version of the language, such as the new version of JavaScript, which is still out, and the new features that have been added to it. Or the new version of the framework, such as the new version of Next, and so on. üöÄüìà

Stay tuned for insightful content that bridges the gap between theory and practical implementation, and keeps you updated with the latest advancements in the tech world! üåêüõ†Ô∏è
